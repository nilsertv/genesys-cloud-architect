# Write & Deploy Architect Flows

Create Genesys Cloud Architect flows as TypeScript, typecheck them, and deploy them via the `deploy_flow` MCP tool.

## Prerequisites

The user's project must have the Architect Scripting SDK installed for type checking:

```bash
npm install --save-dev purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript
```

## Deploy only (existing flow file)

If the user already has a flow file and just wants to deploy it, skip straight to **step 5** — call the `deploy_flow` MCP tool with the file path. Only fall back to steps 1–4 if deployment fails or the user asks for help writing/fixing the flow.

## New flow vs. updating an existing flow

Before writing any code, ask: **is this a brand-new flow, or an edit to a flow that already exists in Genesys Cloud?**

- **New flow** → follow the Workflow below (`buildFlow` + `deploy_flow`).
- **Update an existing flow** → skip to **"Updating an Existing Flow"** below (`updateFlow` + `update_flow`). Do NOT use `deploy_flow`/`buildFlow` to edit a flow that already exists — `deploy_flow`'s underlying `createFlow<Type>Async` path deletes and recreates any flow with the same name, discarding its flow ID and version history.

If unsure which the user means, ask directly — do not guess based on whether a local file already exists, since a local file can describe either a first deploy or a later edit.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the requirement

Ask the user:
- **Flow type**: inbound call, bot flow, digital bot flow, inbound email, inbound message (SMS), or workflow
- **What it should do**: routing, menus, greetings, queue transfers, data lookups, etc.
- **Flow name**: what to name the flow in Architect

Only ask about queue names if the user's description involves queue transfers. Not every flow routes to a queue.

### 2. Read the relevant references

Before writing any flow code, read these reference files from this skill:

1. **Always read**: `references/sdk-patterns.md` — core SDK patterns and the `buildFlow` contract
2. **Always read**: `references/gotchas.md` — SDK quirks that cause silent failures
3. **Always read**: `references/action-reference.md` — available action types
4. **Read when the flow uses expressions**: `references/expression-reference.md` — expression language syntax, functions, operators, data types, and common patterns. Read this whenever the flow involves conditional logic, dynamic text, variable manipulation, date/time calculations, or any `setExpression()` / expression property usage.
5. **Read the matching example** from `references/examples/`:
   - `bot-flow.md` — bot flow with NLU intent detection, slot filling, and testing
   - `digital-bot-flow.md` — digital bot with menu, free-text fallback, and exit
   - `inbound-call.md` — IVR with menus and queue transfers
   - `inbound-email.md` — auto-reply and queue transfer
   - `inbound-message.md` — SMS auto-reply and queue transfer
   - `workflow.md` — callback workflow

### 3. Write the flow file

Write a TypeScript file in the user's project that exports a `buildFlow` function:

```typescript
import type { ArchitectScripting } from "purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript";

export async function buildFlow(scripting: ArchitectScripting): Promise<void> {
    const { archFactoryFlows, archFactoryActions } = scripting.factories;

    const flow = await archFactoryFlows.createFlowInboundCallAsync(
        "Flow Name",
        "Flow Description",
    );

    // Build the flow...

    await flow.checkInAsync();
}
```

**Rules:**
- The function receives the SDK as a parameter — never `require()` the SDK in the flow file
- Only use `import type` from the SDK (stripped at runtime)
- Always call `flow.checkInAsync()` at the end to save the flow
- Use the exact patterns from the reference docs — the SDK is quirky

### 4. Typecheck

Run the TypeScript compiler against the flow file directly (the user's project may not have a `tsconfig.json`):

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --strict --moduleResolution bundler --module ES2022 --target ES2022 --allowImportingTsExtensions --skipLibCheck path/to/flow.ts
```

`--skipLibCheck` is required because the SDK's own `types.d.ts` has internal errors (duplicate identifiers, missing type references). Without it, `tsc` fails on the SDK — not on your flow code.

Fix any errors before deploying.

### 5. Deploy

Use the `deploy_flow` MCP tool:

```
Tool: deploy_flow
Input: { "flowFile": "./path/to/flow.ts" }
```

The tool spawns an isolated process that:
1. Starts an authenticated SDK session using the plugin's Genesys credentials
2. Imports the flow file and calls `buildFlow(scripting)`
3. Returns success/failure with SDK logs

If deployment fails, read the error logs carefully — the SDK has three error channels (logging callback, TRACE lines, HTTP errors) and the deploy runner captures all of them.

**Bot flows — publish before testing:** The `deploy_flow` tool checks in the flow but does not publish it. To test a bot flow or digital bot flow with the `test_bot_flow` tool (step 6), the flow must be published first. Replace `flow.checkInAsync()` with `flow.publishAsync()` in the `buildFlow` function — do not call both, because `checkInAsync` releases the lock and `publishAsync` will fail with a 409:

```typescript
return await flow.publishAsync();
```

### 6. Test (bot flows and digital bot flows)

After deploying and publishing a bot flow or digital bot flow, test it using the `test_bot_flow` MCP tool. The deploy result includes the flow ID.

**Start a session:**
```
Tool: test_bot_flow
Input: { "flowId": "<flow-id-from-deploy>" }
```

The tool returns the bot's opening messages and a `sessionId`. Each turn includes `nextActionType`:
- `WaitForInput` — the bot is waiting for a user message
- `Disconnect` / `Exit` — the conversation has ended

**Send a message:**
```
Tool: test_bot_flow
Input: { "sessionId": "<session-id>", "message": "Billing" }
```

Walk through the flow's conversation paths to verify the bot responds correctly. If the bot behaves unexpectedly, update the flow file, re-deploy, re-publish, and test again.

## Updating an Existing Flow

Use this path when the flow already exists in Genesys Cloud and you want to edit it in place — checkout, apply edits, check-in or publish — without touching its flow ID or version history. This is different from re-running `deploy_flow`, which would delete and recreate the flow.

### 1. Read the relevant references

Same references as a new flow (`sdk-patterns.md`, `gotchas.md`, `action-reference.md`, `expression-reference.md` if needed, and the matching example). The action-building patterns are identical — only the file's exported function and the deploy step differ.

### 2. Write the update file

Write a TypeScript file that exports `updateFlow`, not `buildFlow`:

```typescript
import type { ArchitectScripting } from "purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript";

export async function updateFlow(scripting: ArchitectScripting, flow: unknown): Promise<void> {
    // `flow` is the already-checked-out flow object — mutate it directly.
    // Do NOT call flow.checkInAsync() or flow.publishAsync() here — the
    // deploy-runner calls one of those for you, gated by the `publish` input.
}
```

**Rules:**
- The function receives the SDK **and the already-checked-out flow object** — it does not create a flow itself
- `updateFlow` is edits-only: never call `flow.checkInAsync()` or `flow.publishAsync()` inside it — the tool owns that step so it can guarantee the flow is unlocked on failure
- Only use `import type` from the SDK
- The exact same action/menu/state/expression patterns from `sdk-patterns.md` apply — you're still using `scripting.factories`, just against an existing flow instead of a freshly created one

### 3. Typecheck

Same command as step 4 above, run against the update file.

### 4. Update

Use the `update_flow` MCP tool:

```
Tool: update_flow
Input: {
  "flowFile": "./path/to/update.ts",
  "flowId": "<existing-flow-id>",
  "flowType": "inboundcall",
  "publish": false
}
```

You must supply exactly one of `flowId` or `flowName`. **`flowType` is always required**, even when identifying the flow by `flowId` — the Architect Scripting SDK's checkout methods require it for both lookup paths.

Other inputs:
- `forceUnlock` (default `false`) — forcibly takes over a flow locked by another user, discarding their unsaved Architect UI edits. Only set this when the user explicitly asks to override someone else's lock.
- `publish` (default `false`) — publish the flow after editing instead of just checking it in. Set this when the user wants the change live immediately (and needed to test a bot flow afterward).

If the flow is locked by another user and `forceUnlock` wasn't set, the tool reports a distinct "locked" error — do not silently retry with `forceUnlock: true` without telling the user, since that discards someone else's unsaved work.

If `update_flow` fails and reports the flow lock was NOT automatically released, tell the user explicitly — they may need to manually unlock the flow in the Architect UI.
