# Write & Deploy Architect Flows

Create Genesys Cloud Architect flows as TypeScript, typecheck them, and deploy them via the `deploy_flow` MCP tool.

## Prerequisites

The user's project must have the Architect Scripting SDK installed for type checking:

```bash
npm install --save-dev purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript
```

## Deploy only (existing flow file)

If the user already has a flow file and just wants to deploy it, skip straight to **step 5** — call the `deploy_flow` MCP tool with the file path. Only fall back to steps 1–4 if deployment fails or the user asks for help writing/fixing the flow.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the requirement

Ask the user:
- **Flow type**: inbound call, bot flow, digital bot flow, inbound email, inbound message (SMS), or workflow
- **What it should do**: routing, menus, greetings, queue transfers, data lookups, etc.
- **Flow name**: what to name the flow in Architect

Only ask about queue names if the user's description involves queue transfers. Not every flow routes to a queue.

### 2. Read the relevant references

Before writing any flow code, read these reference files from this skill:

1. **Always read**: `references/sdk-patterns.md` — core SDK patterns and the `buildFlow` contract
2. **Always read**: `references/gotchas.md` — SDK quirks that cause silent failures
3. **Always read**: `references/action-reference.md` — available action types
4. **Read when the flow uses expressions**: `references/expression-reference.md` — expression language syntax, functions, operators, data types, and common patterns. Read this whenever the flow involves conditional logic, dynamic text, variable manipulation, date/time calculations, or any `setExpression()` / expression property usage.
5. **Read the matching example** from `references/examples/`:
   - `bot-flow.md` — bot flow with NLU intent detection, slot filling, and testing
   - `digital-bot-flow.md` — digital bot with menu, free-text fallback, and exit
   - `inbound-call.md` — IVR with menus and queue transfers
   - `inbound-email.md` — auto-reply and queue transfer
   - `inbound-message.md` — SMS auto-reply and queue transfer
   - `workflow.md` — callback workflow

### 3. Write the flow file

Write a TypeScript file in the user's project that exports a `buildFlow` function:

```typescript
import type { ArchitectScripting } from "purecloud-flow-scripting-api-sdk-javascript";

export async function buildFlow(scripting: ArchitectScripting): Promise<void> {
    const { archFactoryFlows, archFactoryActions } = scripting.factories;

    const flow = await archFactoryFlows.createFlowInboundCallAsync(
        "Flow Name",
        "Flow Description",
    );

    // Build the flow...

    await flow.checkInAsync();
}
```

**Rules:**
- The function receives the SDK as a parameter — never `require()` the SDK in the flow file
- Only use `import type` from the SDK (stripped at runtime)
- Always call `flow.checkInAsync()` at the end to save the flow
- Use the exact patterns from the reference docs — the SDK is quirky

### 4. Typecheck

Run the TypeScript compiler against the flow file directly (the user's project may not have a `tsconfig.json`):

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit --strict --moduleResolution bundler --module ES2022 --target ES2022 --allowImportingTsExtensions --skipLibCheck path/to/flow.ts
```

`--skipLibCheck` is required because the SDK's own `types.d.ts` has internal errors (duplicate identifiers, missing type references). Without it, `tsc` fails on the SDK — not on your flow code.

Fix any errors before deploying.

### 5. Deploy

Use the `deploy_flow` MCP tool:

```
Tool: deploy_flow
Input: { "flowFile": "./path/to/flow.ts" }
```

The tool spawns an isolated process that:
1. Starts an authenticated SDK session using the plugin's Genesys credentials
2. Imports the flow file and calls `buildFlow(scripting)`
3. Returns success/failure with SDK logs

If deployment fails, read the error logs carefully — the SDK has three error channels (logging callback, TRACE lines, HTTP errors) and the deploy runner captures all of them.

**Bot flows — publish before testing:** The `deploy_flow` tool checks in the flow but does not publish it. To test a bot flow or digital bot flow with the `test_bot_flow` tool (step 6), the flow must be published first. Replace `flow.checkInAsync()` with `flow.publishAsync()` in the `buildFlow` function — do not call both, because `checkInAsync` releases the lock and `publishAsync` will fail with a 409:

```typescript
return await flow.publishAsync();
```

### 6. Test (bot flows and digital bot flows)

After deploying and publishing a bot flow or digital bot flow, test it using the `test_bot_flow` MCP tool. The deploy result includes the flow ID.

**Start a session:**
```
Tool: test_bot_flow
Input: { "flowId": "<flow-id-from-deploy>" }
```

The tool returns the bot's opening messages and a `sessionId`. Each turn includes `nextActionType`:
- `WaitForInput` — the bot is waiting for a user message
- `Disconnect` / `Exit` — the conversation has ended

**Send a message:**
```
Tool: test_bot_flow
Input: { "sessionId": "<session-id>", "message": "Billing" }
```

Walk through the flow's conversation paths to verify the bot responds correctly. If the bot behaves unexpectedly, update the flow file, re-deploy, re-publish, and test again.

## Reading an Existing Flow Before Editing It

> "Updating an Existing Flow" section (covering the `updateFlow` export and

> (`update-flow`'s Slice C docs, commit `f19d983`) that is not yet merged

> branch-base notes. Once both branches converge, fold this guidance into
> "Updating an Existing Flow", right after its step 2 ("Write the update
> file").

Before writing an `updateFlow` export against a flow that already exists in
Genesys Cloud, call the `read_flow` MCP tool first to see the flow's actual
current structure — states, tasks, variables, and actions, as full YAML.
This is the exact problem that motivated building `read_flow` in the first
place: without it, nobody could see what a flow really looked like before
editing it, so `update_flow` bodies were being written against assumptions
instead of the flow's real, deployed structure.

```
Tool: read_flow
Input: { "flowId": "<existing-flow-id>", "flowType": "inboundcall" }
```

You must supply exactly one of `flowId` or `flowName` (`flowType` is always
required for both). `read_flow` never checks out or locks the flow — call it
freely, including while another edit is already in progress — and read the
returned YAML before deciding what your `updateFlow` edits should actually
change.

See `references/sdk-patterns.md`'s "The `read_flow` Contract" section for
the tool's full input/output shape, and `references/gotchas.md` for
truncation behavior on large flows and `flowVersion` details.
